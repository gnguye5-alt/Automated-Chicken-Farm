## Project Overview
This project develops an automated chicken care system with functionalities of counting chickens, water pumping, and playing music, all overseen by a central Arduino controller. Multiple Arduinos allow efficient, independent task management: the Chicken Counting Arduino tracks movement and updates a display, the Water Pumping Arduino controls water flow based on sensors, and the Music Playing Arduino plays scheduled tunes. The project has a timeline, aiming to create a scalable model for ethical, automated chicken farms.


## Components

### Chicken Counting Arduino
- Tracks the number of chickens passing through a sensor.
- Opens and closes a fence based on chicken detection.
- Sends signals to start music and water pumping when the chicken count reaches 5.
- Updates an LCD display with the current chicken count.

### Music Playing Arduino
- Receives signals from the Chicken Counting Arduino to start playing music.
- Plays the "Fur Elise" tune using a speaker.
- Displays messages on an LCD screen.

### Water Pumping Arduino
- Controls water flow based on water level sensors.
- Receives signals from the Chicken Counting Arduino to start water pumping.
- Uses LEDs to indicate water levels (Empty, Low, Medium, Full).

## Setup Instructions
1. **Chicken Counting Arduino**:
    - Connect the sensor to pin 2.
    - Connect the servo motor to pin 4.
    - Connect the LCD display using I2C.
    - Use SoftwareSerial for communication with the Water Pumping and Music Playing Arduinos.

2. **Music Playing Arduino**:
    - Connect the speaker to pin 7.
    - Connect the LCD display to pins 12, 11, 5, 4, 3, 2.
    - Use SoftwareSerial for communication with the Chicken Counting Arduino.

3. **Water Pumping Arduino**:
    - Connect the water sensor to pin A0.
    - Connect the motor to pin 8.
    - Connect LEDs to pins 3, 4, and 5.
    - Use SoftwareSerial for communication with the Chicken Counting Arduino.

## Communication Protocol
- The Chicken Counting Arduino sends "START_MUSIC" and "START_WATER" commands to the Music Playing and Water Pumping Arduinos respectively when the chicken count reaches 5.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement more sophisticated algorithms for chicken detection and counting.
- Add more tunes to the Music Playing Arduino.
- Integrate more sensors for better monitoring and control of the chicken farm environment.
